# Sophiie AI Agents Hackathon 2026

**Build the future of AI-human interaction.**

| | |
|---|---|
| **What** | A solo hackathon focused on AI agent interaction — voice, text, UX, and UI |
| **When** | February 14–15, 2026 (Saturday–Sunday) |
| **Where** | Virtual — participate from anywhere in Australia |
| **Prize** | **$5,000 AUD cash** (1st place) + job offers for top performers |
| **Format** | Solo only — show us what *you* can build |
| **Hacking Time** | 33 hours |

## The Challenge

**Design and build an AI agent with an exceptional interaction experience.**

We want to see how you think about the space between humans and AI. This is deliberately open-ended — you choose the problem, the modality, and the approach. What matters is the *interaction*.

Some directions to inspire you (not requirements):

- A voice agent that feels natural to talk to
- A text-based assistant with a thoughtful, intuitive UX
- A multi-modal agent that blends voice, text, and visual elements
- An agent that handles a complex workflow through conversation
- Something we haven't thought of yet

**You will be judged on innovation, technical execution, and how good the interaction feels** — not just whether the AI works, but whether a human would *want* to use it.

Use any tech stack. Use any AI provider. Use AI coding assistants. The only constraint is time.

## Rules

### The Essentials

1. **Solo only** — one person per submission, no teams
2. **No pre-work** — all project code must be written during the hackathon window (after 9:30 AM AEST, Feb 14)
3. **Public GitHub repo** — your repository must be publicly visible at time of submission
4. **AI assistance is allowed** — Copilot, Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, whatever you want. You still need to build it within the timeframe
5. **Must be functional** — your project must run and be demonstrable, not just a concept or slide deck
6. **One submission per person** — you may iterate, but submit one final project

### What You CAN Prepare Before Kickoff

- Research, planning, and brainstorming (on paper, in your head — just not in code)
- Setting up your development environment
- Reading documentation for tools/APIs you plan to use
- Creating accounts (GitHub, API providers, etc.)
- Watching tutorials

### What You CANNOT Do Before Kickoff

- Write any project code
- Create your project repository
- Fork/clone an existing project and modify it
- Build components, libraries, or templates specifically for your submission
- Start a project in a private repo then make it public later

### How We Verify

We will check:
- **Repository creation date** — must be after 9:30 AM AEST, Feb 14
- **Commit history** — should show natural progression, not a single massive commit
- **First commit timestamp** — must be after kickoff

**Red flags that will result in disqualification:**
- Repo created before the hackathon
- Single commit containing the entire project
- Commits timestamped before kickoff
- Evidence of code copied from a pre-existing private repo

## Submission Requirements

**Deadline: 6:00 PM AEST, Sunday February 15, 2026 — hard cut-off.**

To submit, you must complete **all** of the following:

1. **Public GitHub repo** — created after kickoff, with a clear commit history
2. **This README** — fill out the [Your Submission](#your-submission) section below
3. **Demo video** (2–5 minutes) — show your agent in action, explain your approach
4. **Working project** — judges must be able to understand and evaluate your agent from the repo + video

### How to Submit

1. Fork this repository
2. Build your project in the fork
3. Fill out the [Your Submission](#your-submission) section below
4. Record your demo video and add the link to your submission
5. Ensure your repo is **public** before 6:00 PM AEST Sunday
6. Submit your repo link via the submission form (link will be shared at kickoff)

## FAQ

**Q: Can I use boilerplate / starter templates?**
A: You can use publicly available boilerplate (e.g., `create-react-app`, `Next.js` starter) as a starting point. You cannot use custom templates you built specifically for this hackathon before kickoff.

**Q: Can I use existing open-source libraries and APIs?**
A: Yes. You can use any publicly available libraries, frameworks, APIs, and services. The code *you* write must be created during the hackathon.

**Q: Do I need to be in Australia?**
A: Preferred but not strictly required. The hackathon is primarily targeted at Australian residents and students, but we won't turn away great talent.

**Q: Can I use AI coding tools like Copilot or Claude?**
A: Absolutely. Use whatever tools you want. The 33-hour time constraint is the great equalizer.

**Q: What if I can't finish?**
A: Submit what you have. A well-thought-out partial project with a great demo video can still score well. We're evaluating your thinking and skill, not just completion.

**Q: How will I know if I won?**
A: Winners will be announced via livestream approximately 2 weeks after the hackathon. All participants will be notified.

**Q: Can I keep working on my project after the deadline?**
A: You can continue developing after the hackathon, but **only the state of your repo at 6:00 PM AEST Sunday Feb 15 will be judged**. We will check commit timestamps.
